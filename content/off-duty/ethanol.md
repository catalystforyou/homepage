- Matured in old oak beer casks and finished in wine casks, very special flavor.

{{< card image="https://img.junren.li/camphoto_959030623.jpg" title="First highball in Korea" >}}
- 2024.10
- It was a standard highball made with regular whisky... however, this was the first alcoholic beverage I had after arriving in Korea. I had been abstinent for over a week because the convenience stores within UNIST do not sell alcohol, and there are no stores near the campus. This highball was truly my savior at that time.

{{< card image="https://img.junren.li/IMG_3903.jpeg" title="Special Menu in an Irish pub, Munich" >}}
- 2025.6
- Probably the finest whisky menu I had ever seen at that time—so many rare expressions and specialized bottlings.
{{< /card >}}

{{< card image="https://img.junren.li/IMG_3904.jpeg" title="Regular Menu in an Irish pub, Munich" >}}
- 2025.6

{{< /card >}}

{{< card image="https://img.junren.li/IMG_3908.jpeg" title="Glenfarclas 25 from the Irish pub" >}}
- Twenty-five years! It is likely older than I am (well, for sure).
{{< /card >}}

{{< card image="https://img.junren.li/IMG_3912.jpeg" title="BLAIR ATHOL 12 from the Irish pub" >}}
- Single Cask. Only 298 bottles in this batch.
{{< /card >}}

{{< card image="https://img.junren.li/IMG_3914.jpeg" title="Arran 17 from the Irish pub" >}}
- Rare batch, only 12,000 bottles released.
- A total Sherry Bomb!
{{< /card >}}

{{< card image="https://img.junren.li/IMG_3912.jpeg" title="Ardbeg from the Irish pub" >}}
- Peat Monster!
{{< /card >}}

{{< card image="https://img.junren.li/IMG_3912.jpeg" title="The bill for that night" >}}
- Spent about 100 euros (or more, I was just too happy to count) that night...
{{< /card >}}

{{< card image="https://img.junren.li/IMG_6183.jpeg" title="Gold Label, Johnnie Walker" >}}
- A reasonably good taste with a moderate price for a blended whisky.
{{< /card >}}

{{< card image="https://img.junren.li/IMG_6183.jpeg" title="Hibiki (Suntory)" >}}
- Exquisite and expensive. It was actually a gift from a friend, and I sincerely thank him for this.
{{< /card >}}

{{< card image="https://img.junren.li/IMG_6185.jpeg" title="Clynelish 14" >}}
- A classic Highland style with its distinctive waxy notes and higher ABV.
{{< /card >}}

{{< card image="https://img.junren.li/IMG_6180.jpeg" title="Johnnie Walker Black Label (Sherry Finish)" >}}
- A sherry-cask finished blend... but I wonder why they made this?
{{< /card >}}

{{< card image="https://img.junren.li/IMG_6181.jpeg" title="Glengoyne 12" >}}
{{< /card >}}

{{< card image="https://img.junren.li/IMG_6179.jpeg" title="Akashi" >}}
- Mild, yet tasty Japanese whisky.
{{< /card >}}

{{< card image="https://img.junren.li/IMG_6186.jpeg" title="Platinum Label, Johnnie Walker" >}}
- A decent, balanced blended whisky. The bottle itself features a unique design.
{{< /card >}}

{{< card image="https://img.junren.li/IMG_6187.jpeg" title="Fenjiu Qinghua 20 (汾酒 青花20)" >}}
- Among all Baijiu, Fenjiu is my favorite. Qinghua 20 is undoubtedly a classic masterpiece. This was also a gift from a good friend.
{{< /card >}}

{{< card image="https://img.junren.li/IMG_6188.jpeg" title="Gin from Tobermory" >}}
- I bought this simply because I love Tobermory's whisky, but this gin turned out to be an excellent spirit as well.
{{< /card >}}

{{< card image="https://img.junren.li/IMG_6189.jpeg" title="Absinthe" >}}
- High ABV with thujone inside. Maybe it causes hallucinations, but I just used it to make a Sazerac.
- Also a gift from a dear friend in Germany.
{{< /card >}}

{{< card image="https://img.junren.li/IMG_6190.jpeg" title="Deanston 12" >}}
- Standard profile (Honey & Waxy), didn't leave a strong impression on me.
{{< /card >}}

{{< card image="https://img.junren.li/IMG_6191.jpeg" title="Laizhou (崃州甄选)" >}}
- I bought this to support the domestic whisky industry. The palate is actually quite decent with some complex flavors, comparable to international brands. However, the finish is a bit short and watery—likely due to its young age, which only time can fix.
{{< /card >}}

{{< card image="https://img.junren.li/IMG_6192.jpeg" title="Mysterious Laphroaig 16 from an IB" >}}
- I managed to get the last 200ml residue from a tasting event. It offers an explosive combination of peat and sherry flavors—pure magic.
{{< /card >}}

{{< card image="https://img.junren.li/IMG_6193.jpeg" title="Tobermory 12" >}}
- My favorite daily dram. Very balanced flavor and easy to drink, with a friendly price tag.

{{< /card >}}

{{< card image="https://img.junren.li/IMG_6198.jpeg" title="Singleton Golden Autumn Orchard" >}}
- Bought from the airport duty-free. I meant to keep it as a gift for friends, but I couldn't help but open it... and finally drank it all.
