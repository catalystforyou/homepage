- 2024.10
- It was a standard highball made with regular whisky... however, this was the first alcoholic beverage I had after arriving in Korea. I had been abstinent for over a week because the convenience stores within UNIST do not sell alcohol, and there are no stores near the campus. This highball was truly my savior at that time.

- 2025.6
- Probably the finest whisky menu I had ever seen at that time—so many rare expressions and specialized bottlings.

{{< card image="https://img.junren.li/IMG_6185.jpg" title="Clynelish 14" >}}

{{< ethanol-cards >}}
{{< card image="https://img.junren.li/IMG_6180.jpg" title="Johnnie Walker Black Label (Sherry Finish)" >}}

{{< card image="https://img.junren.li/IMG_6187.jpg" title="Fenjiu Qinghua 20 (汾酒 青花20)" >}}

{{< card image="https://img.junren.li/IMG_6188.jpg" title="Gin from Tobermory" >}}

{{< ethanol-cards >}}
{{< card image="https://img.junren.li/IMG_6189.jpg" title="Absinthe" >}}
- High ABV with thujone inside. Maybe it causes hallucinations, but I just used it to make a Sazerac.
- Also a gift from a dear friend in Germany.

{{< card image="https://img.junren.li/IMG_6191.jpg" title="Laizhou (崃州甄选)" >}}
- I bought this to support the domestic whisky industry. The palate is actually quite decent with some complex flavors, comparable to international brands. However, the finish is a bit short and watery—likely due to its young age, which only time can fix.

{{< card image="https://img.junren.li/IMG_6192.jpg" title="Mysterious Laphroaig 16 from an IB" >}}
