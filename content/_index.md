            I am currently a Ph.D. candidate at the College of Chemistry and Molecular Engineering, Peking University, where I also received my B.S. in Chemistry (2018–2022). I am fortunate to be advised by <a href="https://scholar.google.com/citations?user=8NJFCTYAAAAJ" target="_blank">Prof. Luhua Lai</a> and <a href="https://www.chem.pku.edu.cn/liuzhirong/en/Members/professor/index.htm" target="_blank">Prof. Zhirong Liu</a>.
        </p>

            My research philosophy is rooted in a single, driving ambition: to accelerate scientific discovery by bridging the gap between fundamental chemistry and artificial intelligence. I am passionate about liberating researchers from the tedious trial-and-error loops of traditional experiments through data-driven approaches and automation.
        </p>
        <p>
            My primary research interests lie in chemical reaction prediction, including:
        </p>
        <ul>
            <li><strong>Retrosynthesis Planning:</strong> Navigating the vast chemical space to find optimal synthetic routes.</li>
            <li><strong>Reaction Mechanism Analysis:</strong> Deciphering the underlying logic of chemical transformations.</li>
            <li><strong>Reaction Procedure Recommendation:</strong> Predicting experimental actions to maximize yield and efficiency.</li>
        </ul>
        <p>
            Beyond my academic studies at Peking University, my journey has been shaped by continuous engagement with world-class research labs. I have spent extensive time as a research intern within the Microsoft Research (MSR) ecosystem, collaborating with leading experts to push the boundaries of AI for Science. This includes my time at MSRA (May 2022 – Nov 2023) with <a href="https://scholar.google.com/citations?user=RLtfipAAAAAJ" target="_blank">Dr. Lei Fang</a>, and MSR AI4S Asia (Mar 2025 – Sep 2025) with <a href="https://fiberleif.github.io/" target="_blank">Dr. Guoqing Liu</a>. Looking ahead, I will join MSR AI4S Cambridge in Jan 2026 to continue exploring the intersection of LLMs and chemistry.

            To ensure my computational work remains grounded in physical reality, I also served as a visiting research student at the Center for Algorithmic and Roboticized Synthesis, IBS (Oct 2024 – Dec 2024). Advised by <a href="http://www.grzybowski-group.net/people/bartosz.asp" target="_blank">Prof. Bartosz Grzybowski</a>, I gained valuable insights into chemical automation and catalyst development, effectively balancing my AI expertise with deep chemical domain knowledge.

        <p>
            I am always open to discussions on AI, Chemistry, and the future of automated science.
